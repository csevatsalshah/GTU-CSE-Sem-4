**Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)**: The average daily balance that a bank is required to maintain with the Reserve Bank as a share of such per cent of its Net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). The CRR is determined by the RBI and can be modified from time to time.

**Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)**: The share of Net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that a bank is required to maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as government securities, cash and gold.

## Q-5.3. How RBI governs the economy through different banking rates?

**Answer:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governs the economy and manages monetary policy through various banking rates and tools. These rates are used to control the supply of money in the economy, influence interest rates, and ultimately impact factors like inflation, economic growth, and employment. Here's how RBI governs the economy through different banking rates:

1. **Repo Rate**: By adjusting the repo rate, the rate at which RBI lends to commercial banks, the central bank can influence the cost of borrowing for banks. A higher repo rate makes it more expensive for banks to borrow from RBI, which can lead to higher interest rates charged to customers, discouraging borrowing and spending, thereby controlling inflation.

2. **Reverse Repo Rate**: The reverse repo rate is the rate at which RBI borrows from commercial banks. By increasing the reverse repo rate, RBI can incentivize banks to park their excess funds with the central bank rather than lending it out, effectively reducing the money supply in the economy and controlling inflation.

3. **Bank Rate**: The bank rate is the rate at which RBI is ready to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers. By adjusting the bank rate, RBI can influence the overall interest rate structure in the economy, impacting borrowing costs and investment decisions.

4. **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)**: By increasing the CRR, the portion of deposits that banks must maintain with RBI, the central bank can reduce the amount of funds available for lending by commercial banks. This reduction in the money supply can help control inflation.

5. **Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)**: By modifying the SLR, the portion of deposits that banks must maintain in safe and liquid assets like government securities, RBI can influence the availability of resources for lending to the private sector, thereby impacting economic growth and investment.

6. **Open Market Operations (OMOs)**: Through the purchase or sale of government securities, RBI can inject or absorb liquidity from the economy, influencing the overall money supply and interest rates.

By carefully adjusting these banking rates and tools, RBI aims to strike a balance between managing inflation and promoting economic growth, while also ensuring financial stability and maintaining the external value of the Indian rupee.

**Detailed Summary:**
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governs the economy and manages monetary policy through various banking rates and tools, such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, bank rate, cash reserve ratio (CRR), statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), and open market operations (OMOs). By adjusting these rates and tools, RBI can influence the money supply, interest rates, and overall liquidity in the economy, thereby impacting factors like inflation, economic growth, investment, and employment. RBI aims to strike a balance between managing inflation and promoting economic growth while ensuring financial stability and maintaining the external value of the Indian rupee.

**Points to Remember:**
- RBI governs the economy through banking rates like repo rate, reverse repo rate, bank rate, CRR, SLR, and OMOs.
