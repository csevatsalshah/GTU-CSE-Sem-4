## Q-8.4. How does culture affect managers?

**Answer:** Organizational culture can significantly affect the attitudes and behaviors of managers in the following ways:

1. **Motivation:** The company's culture can motivate or demotivate managers based on whether it aligns with their personal drivers. For example, a culture that rewards innovative thinking can positively influence problem-solving attitudes, or it may overwhelm managers who excel in other areas like finance.

2. **Leadership:** The organizational culture shapes managers' attitudes towards leadership. A culture that grooms leaders from within can foster positive leadership attitudes, while deviating from this by hiring externally may negatively impact managerial attitudes.

3. **Ambiguous cultures:** Unclear or ambiguous cultures can change managers' attitudes from positive to negative. Without clear guidelines and support, managers may become reactive, avoid responsibility, or exhibit a victimized attitude.

4. **Ethics:** When the organizational culture upholds high ethical standards, managers with strong values are more likely to align with and adhere to these standards. Failing to enforce ethical breaches can undermine the culture and lead managers to ignore ethical lapses.

## Q-8.5. How does culture affect employees?

**Answer:** Organizational culture has a significant impact on employee performance and behavior:

1. **Commitment and alignment:** In cultures where employees are integral to growth, they align their goals with the organization's objectives, fostering commitment and job satisfaction.

2. **Fear and distrust:** Cultures with authoritarian management styles can create an environment of fear and distrust, leading to disengagement and lack of commitment among employees.

3. **Silos and conflict:** Lack of cooperation and collaboration between departments can result in employees working in silos or undermining each other's efforts, hampering overall organizational performance.

4. **Positive workplace environment:** A positive organizational culture that values employee contributions, provides growth opportunities, and fosters teamwork can significantly enhance employee performance and job satisfaction.

## Q-8.6. How does external environment affect organization?

**Answer:** The external environment can significantly impact an organization's performance and operations. The key external factors are:

1. **Specific environment:**
   - Customers: Their demands, preferences, and satisfaction levels directly affect the organization's outputs.
   - Suppliers: Their reliability, pricing, and quality of materials/equipment can impact operations.
   - Competitors: Their strategies, products/services, and market positioning influence the organization's competitive position.
   - Pressure groups: Special interest groups can influence policies and regulations affecting the organization.

2. **General environment:**
   - Economic conditions: Interest rates, disposable income levels, and business cycles impact consumer demand and organizational performance.
   - Political/legal conditions: Government regulations, policies, and laws can create opportunities or constraints for the organization.
   - Socio-cultural conditions: Societal values, customs, and tastes shape consumer preferences and expectations.
   - Demographic conditions: Population trends, such as age, ethnicity, and income distribution, can affect the demand for products/services.
   - Technological conditions: Rapid technological advancements can render existing products/services obsolete or create new opportunities.
   - Global conditions: International competitors, consumer markets, and economic factors can influence the organization's global operations and strategies.

**Detailed Summary:**
Organizational culture significantly shapes the attitudes and behaviors of managers and employees within an organization. For managers, it can influence their motivation, leadership styles, decision-making, and ethical conduct. A strong culture that aligns with managers' values can positively impact their attitudes, while ambiguous or misaligned cultures can lead to negative attitudes, reactivity, and ethical lapses.

Similarly, organizational culture affects employee performance, commitment, and job satisfaction. Cultures that involve employees in growth, foster teamwork, and provide growth opportunities lead to higher engagement and productivity. Conversely, authoritarian cultures, lack of cooperation, and negative environments can result in fear, distrust, and disengagement among employees.

Additionally, the external environment, including specific factors like customers, suppliers, competitors, and pressure groups, as well as general factors like economic, political, socio-cultural, demographic, technological, and global conditions, can significantly impact an organization's operations, strategies, and performance. Organizations must continuously monitor and adapt to these external factors to remain competitive and successful.
