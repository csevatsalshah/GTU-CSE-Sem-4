## Q-1: Define tree. Prove that there is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in a tree $\( T \)$.

Explanation:

1. **Definition of Tree**:
   - A tree is a connected acyclic graph with $\( n \)$ vertices and $\( n-1 \)$ edges.
   - It is a special type of graph where there is exactly one path between every pair of vertices.
   - Characteristics:
     - No cycles.
     - Connectedness: Every pair of vertices is connected by exactly one path.
     - Acyclicity: There are no cycles present in the graph.

2. **Proof of One and Only One Path**:
   - Suppose $\( T \)$ is a tree with $\( n \)$ vertices.
   - To prove that there is one and only one path between every pair of vertices, we can use induction on the number of vertices $\( n \)$:
     - **Base Case $\( n = 1 \)$**:
       - For a tree with only one vertex, there are no edges, and hence no paths between any pair of vertices. This trivially satisfies the condition.
     - **Inductive Step**:
       - Assume the statement holds for all trees with $\( k \)$ vertices, where $\( k < n \)$.
       - Now consider a tree $\( T \)$ with $\( n \)$ vertices.
       - Since $\( T \)$ is connected, there exists at least one path between any two vertices.
       - If there were more than one path between any pair of vertices, a cycle would be formed, contradicting the definition of a tree.
       - Hence, there is only one path between every pair of vertices in $\( T \)$.
   - Therefore, by mathematical induction, we have proved that there is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in a tree $\( T \)$.

This proof establishes the fundamental property of trees, which is crucial in various applications in computer science, including algorithms and data structures.

## Q-2:A tree T has 4 vertices of degree 2, 4 vertices of degree 3, 2 vertices of degree 4. Find the number of pendant vertices in T.

Explanation:

1. **Tree Description**:
   - Given a tree $\( T \)$ with certain vertex degrees:
     - Vertices of degree 2: $\( 4 \)$ vertices
     - Vertices of degree 3: $\( 4 \)$ vertices
     - Vertices of degree 4: $\( 2 \)$ vertices

2. **Calculation of Pendant Vertices**:
   - Pendant vertices are vertices with degree 1, which are the endpoints of the tree branches.
   - In a tree, each edge connects exactly two vertices. Since there are $\( n-1 \)$ edges in a tree with $\( n \)$ vertices, and each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices, the sum of degrees of all vertices in a tree is twice the number of edges.
   - Let $\( E \)$ be the set of edges in the tree. Then, $\( \sum_{v \in V} \text{degree}(v) = 2|E| \)$.
   - Given:
     - Vertices of degree 2: $\( 4 \)$ vertices
     - Vertices of degree 3: $\( 4 \)$ vertices
     - Vertices of degree 4: $\( 2 \)$ vertices
   - Using the given information, we can calculate the total number of edges in the tree:
     $\[
     \begin{align*}
     \text{Total number of edges} &= \frac{1}{2} \times \left( 2 \times 4 + 3 \times 4 + 4 \times 2 \right) \\
     &= 10
     \end{align*}
     \]$

3. **Calculation of Pendant Vertices**:
   - Since each edge connects two vertices, and each edge has one pendant vertex, the total number of pendant vertices is equal to the total number of edges.
   - Therefore, there are $\( 10 \)$ pendant vertices in the tree $\( T \)$.

Thus, the number of pendant vertices in tree $\( T \)$ is $\( \boxed{10} \)$.

## Q-3: Define a tree and prove that if a graph $\( G \)$ has one and only one path between every pair of vertices, then $\( G \)$ is a tree.

Explanation:

1. **Definition of a Tree**:
   - A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic. In a tree:
     - There is exactly one path between every pair of vertices.
     - There are no cycles, meaning there are no repeated edges or paths between vertices.

2. **Proof**:
   - Let's assume that graph $\( G \)$ has one and only one path between every pair of vertices.
   - We need to show that $\( G \)$ is a tree, which means we need to demonstrate that it is connected and acyclic.

3. **Connectedness**:
   - Since there is one and only one path between every pair of vertices, the graph $\( G \)$ is connected.
   - If there were disconnected components, there would exist at least two vertices that cannot be reached from each other by a path, contradicting the assumption.

4. **Acyclic Property**:
   - Suppose there exists a cycle in graph $\( G \)$.
   - Let $\( u \)$ and $\( v \)$ be two vertices in this cycle that are connected by an edge $\( e \)$.
   - Since there is only one path between $\( u \)$ and $\( v \)$, removing edge $\( e \)$ disconnects the graph.
   - This contradicts the assumption that $\( G \)$ is connected.
   - Therefore, graph $\( G \)$ must be acyclic.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since graph $\( G \)$ is both connected and acyclic, it satisfies the properties of a tree.
   - Hence, if a graph has one and only one path between every pair of vertices, it is a tree.

Therefore, the statement is proven.

## Q-4: Definition of the Radius of a Tree

`Eccentricity in a tree refers to the maximum distance between a vertex $\( v \)$ and any other vertex in the tree. In simpler terms, it measures how far a particular vertex is from the farthest vertex in the tree.`

`Here's a breakdown:`

`- **Eccentricity of a Vertex:** For each vertex $\( v \)$ in the tree, its eccentricity is calculated as the maximum distance (number of edges) between $\( v \)$ and any other vertex in the tree.`

`- **Maximum Eccentricity:** The maximum eccentricity among all vertices in the tree represents the longest shortest path from any vertex to any other vertex in the tree. This value provides insight into the overall shape and spread of the tree.`

`- **Minimum Eccentricity (Radius):** Conversely, the minimum eccentricity among all vertices in the tree represents the shortest longest path from any vertex to any other vertex in the tree. This value is known as the radius of the tree and indicates the centrality or compactness of the tree structure.`

`Understanding eccentricity helps in analyzing the structural properties of a tree and is useful in various applications, such as network design and optimization algorithms.`

**Definition:**
The radius of a tree $\( T \)$ is the minimum eccentricity of any vertex in the tree. The eccentricity of a vertex $\( v \)$ in a tree is the maximum distance between $\( v \)$ and any other vertex in the tree.

**Visual Representation:**

Consider the following tree $\( T \)$:

```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   /|   |\
  D E   F G
       / \
      H   I
```

In this tree, the eccentricity of each vertex is as follows:
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( A \)$: 3
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( B \)$: 4
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( C \)$: 3
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( D \)$: 5
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( E \)$: 5
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( F \)$: 4
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( G \)$: 4
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( H \)$: 5
- Eccentricity of vertex $\( I \)$: 5

The radius of the tree $\( T \)$ is the minimum eccentricity, which is 3.

**Significance:**
- The radius of a tree indicates the centrality or compactness of its structure.
- It provides insights into the overall shape and connectivity of the tree.
- It is useful in various applications, such as network design, where minimizing the radius can lead to more efficient and reliable communication.

In summary, the radius of a tree is the minimum eccentricity among all vertices, representing its centrality or compactness.

## Q-5: Define Tree

`A tree is a connected undirected graph where each pair of vertices is connected by exactly one unique path, ensuring no isolated vertices exist and all vertices are reachable from each other. It is acyclic, meaning there are no loops or cycles present, ensuring a hierarchical structure without redundant edges. Additionally, a tree is minimally connected, as removing any edge disconnects it into two separate components, and adding any additional edge creates a cycle. Trees are widely used in computer science and mathematics for representing hierarchical data structures, organizing information, and facilitating efficient algorithms like binary search trees and tree traversal techniques. `

A tree is a connected undirected graph with the following properties:

1. **Connectedness:** Every pair of vertices in a tree is connected by exactly one unique path. This means that there are no isolated vertices, and any two vertices can be reached from each other by traversing the edges of the tree.

2. **Acyclic Nature:** A tree contains no cycles or loops. There are no closed paths where a vertex is visited more than once. This property ensures that there are no redundant edges, and the structure of the tree is hierarchical without any looping back to previous vertices.

3. **Minimal Connectivity:** A tree is minimally connected, meaning that removing any edge from the tree will disconnect it into two separate components. Adding any additional edge between two vertices will create a cycle, violating the acyclic nature of the tree.

In summary, a tree is a graph that is connected, acyclic, and minimally connected, forming a hierarchical structure without loops or redundant edges.

**Characteristics of a Tree:**
- Trees are widely used in computer science and mathematics for representing hierarchical data structures, organizing information, and solving various problems efficiently.
- The vertices of a tree are often categorized into levels, where the root node is at level 0, its children are at level 1, their children are at level 2, and so on.
- Trees play a crucial role in algorithms such as binary search trees, heap data structures, and tree traversal algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

Understanding the properties and characteristics of trees is fundamental in various areas of computer science, including data structures, algorithm design, and network topology analysis.

## Q-6)

**Definition of Tree and Root**:
A **tree** in graph theory is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic, meaning there are no cycles. In a tree:
- Each pair of vertices is connected by exactly one path.
- There are no circuits or loops.
- A **root** in a tree is a designated node from which all other nodes are reachable. It serves as the starting point for traversing the tree.

**Proof that a Tree with n Vertices has n−1 Edges**:
We prove this statement by induction on the number of vertices, n.

**Base Case (n = 1)**:
For a tree with only one vertex, there are no edges, and $\(n - 1 = 0\)$ edges. So, the statement holds for n = 1.

**Inductive Step**:
Assume that the statement is true for some positive integer k, where k ≥ 1, i.e., a tree with k vertices has k − 1 edges.

Now, consider a tree T with k + 1 vertices. Select any leaf node v in the tree T (a leaf node is a vertex with degree 1). Removing this leaf node v from the tree creates a smaller tree T' with k vertices and k − 1 edges by the inductive hypothesis.

When we add back the leaf node v, we introduce exactly one edge to connect it to the rest of the tree T'. Since v is a leaf, adding it does not create a cycle, maintaining the tree structure. Therefore, the tree T has (k − 1) + 1 = k edges.

Thus, by induction, a tree with n vertices has n − 1 edges for all positive integers n.

This concludes the proof.


## Q-7) Define tree and root. Also prove that tree with n vertices has n−1 edges.
`answer of Also prove that tree with n vertices has n−1 edges might be wrong`
A **tree** in graph theory is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic, meaning there are no cycles. In a tree:
- Each pair of vertices is connected by exactly one path.
- There are no circuits or loops.
- A **root** in a tree is a designated node from which all other nodes are reachable. It serves as the starting point for traversing the tree.

**Proof that a Tree with n Vertices has n−1 Edges**:
We prove this statement by induction on the number of vertices, n.

**Base Case (n = 1)**:
For a tree with only one vertex, there are no edges, and $\(n - 1 = 0\)$ edges. So, the statement holds for n = 1.

**Inductive Step**:
Assume that the statement is true for some positive integer k, where k ≥ 1, i.e., a tree with k vertices has k − 1 edges.

Now, consider a tree T with k + 1 vertices. Select any leaf node v in the tree T (a leaf node is a vertex with degree 1). Removing this leaf node v from the tree creates a smaller tree T' with k vertices and k − 1 edges by the inductive hypothesis.

When we add back the leaf node v, we introduce exactly one edge to connect it to the rest of the tree T'. Since v is a leaf, adding it does not create a cycle, maintaining the tree structure. Therefore, the tree T has (k − 1) + 1 = k edges.

Thus, by induction, a tree with n vertices has n − 1 edges for all positive integers n.

This concludes the proof.


## Q-8) Definition of Subtree and Degree of a Node

**Subtree**:
In a tree, a subtree is a tree that is formed by selecting a node, called the root of the subtree, and all of its descendants. Formally, if T is a tree with root node r, and v is any node in T, then the subtree rooted at v, denoted as T(v), is the tree consisting of v and all nodes and edges reachable from v in T. Essentially, a subtree is a smaller tree contained within the original tree.

**Degree of a Node**:
In a tree, the degree of a node is the number of edges incident to it, i.e., the number of children it has. For a tree node v, the degree is denoted as deg(v). Specifically:
- For a leaf node (a node with no children), the degree is 1.
- For an internal node (a node with one or more children), the degree is the number of children it has.

**Example**:
Consider the following tree:

```
     A
    / \
   B   C
  / \
 D   E
```



- The subtree rooted at node B includes nodes B, D, and E.
- The degree of node A is 2 because it has 2 children (B and C).
- The degree of node B is 2 because it has 2 children (D and E).
- The degree of nodes D and E is 0 because they are leaf nodes.

## Q-12) Form a binary search tree for the data 16,24,7,5,8,20,40,3.

To form a binary search tree (BST) from the given data {16, 24, 7, 5, 8, 20, 40, 3}, we follow the property of a BST, where for each node:
- All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
- All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

Here's how the BST is formed step by step:

1. Start with the root node, which is 16.
2. Insert 24: Since 24 > 16, it goes to the right of 16.
3. Insert 7: Since 7 < 16, it goes to the left of 16.
4. Insert 5: Since 5 < 16, it goes to the left of 16 and then to the left of 7.
5. Insert 8: Since 8 > 7, it goes to the right of 7.
6. Insert 20: Since 20 > 16, it goes to the right of 16 and then to the left of 24.
7. Insert 40: Since 40 > 16, it goes to the right of 16 and then to the right of 24.
8. Insert 3: Since 3 < 16, it goes to the left of 16, then to the left of 7, and finally to the left of 5.

The final binary search tree looks like this:

```
       16
      /  \
     7    24
    / \   / \
   5   8 20 40
  /
 3
```

This binary search tree satisfies the property of a BST, where the left subtree of each node contains values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.
  
## Q-13 Explain Post order traversal. Given the postorder and inorder traversal of a binary tree, draw the unique binary tree.
###Postorder: d e c f b h i g a
###Inorder: d c e b f a h g i.
**Postorder Traversal**:

Postorder traversal is a depth-first traversal method in binary trees where the nodes are visited in the following order: left subtree, right subtree, root. In other words, the traversal starts from the leftmost leaf node, then goes to the right subtree, and finally visits the root node.

**Explanation**:
1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Traverse the right subtree.
3. Visit the root node.

**Given Postorder and Inorder Traversals**:

Postorder: d e c f b h i g a
Inorder: d c e b f a h g i

**Unique Binary Tree Construction**:

To construct the unique binary tree from the given postorder and inorder traversals, we follow these steps:

1. Identify the root node from the postorder traversal (the last element), which is "a".
2. Locate the position of the root node in the inorder traversal. All elements to the left of the root in the inorder traversal belong to the left subtree, and all elements to the right belong to the right subtree.
3. Recursively repeat steps 1 and 2 for the left and right subtrees.

Let's construct the binary tree:

1. Root node: "a"
2. In the inorder traversal, elements to the left of "a" are {d, c, e, b, f}, and elements to the right are {h, g, i}.
3. Recursively construct the left and right subtrees using the above steps.

```
        a
      /   \
     /     \
    b       i
   / \     / \
  d   f   h   g
     / \
    c   e
```

This is the unique binary tree constructed from the given postorder and inorder traversals.

## Q-14) Draw a binary tree whose post-order produced the string d − g −e −b −i − j − h − f −c − a and pre-order produces the string j −b − a −c − d −i − h −e − g − f

To construct the binary tree from the given post-order and pre-order traversals, we need to follow certain rules:

1. In pre-order traversal, the root node is always the first node visited, while in post-order traversal, the root node is always the last node visited.
2. Using the pre-order traversal, we determine the root node. Then, in the post-order traversal, we find the position of the root node, which divides the tree into left and right subtrees.
3. Recursively, we construct the left and right subtrees based on the above steps.

Let's construct the binary tree:

```
             j
           /   \
          /     \
         /       \
        b         c
       / \       / \
      /   \     /   \
     a     i   d     e
           /       / \
          h       g   f
```

This binary tree corresponds to the given post-order and pre-order traversals.

## A tree T has 3 vertices of degree 4, 3 vertices of degree 3. Find the number of pendant vertices in tree T.

Given that the tree T has 3 vertices of degree 4 and 3 vertices of degree 3, we can calculate the total number of pendant vertices as follows:

Each vertex of degree 4 contributes 4 edges, and each vertex of degree 3 contributes 3 edges. Since each edge connects two vertices, the total number of edges in the tree can be calculated by summing the contributions from all vertices:

$\[ \text{Total edges} = (3 \times 4) + (3 \times 3) = 12 + 9 = 21 \]$

In a tree with $\( n \)$ vertices, there are $\( n - 1 \)$ edges. Therefore, in tree T:

$\[ n - 1 = 21 \]$

$\[ n = 21 + 1 = 22 \]$

The total number of vertices in tree T is 22.

Now, to find the number of pendant vertices (vertices of degree 1), we subtract the number of internal vertices (non-pendant) from the total number of vertices:

$\[ \text{Number of pendant vertices} = \text{Total vertices} - \text{Number of internal vertices} \]$

Each internal vertex has a degree greater than 1. In tree T, there are 3 vertices of degree 4 and 3 vertices of degree 3, which are internal vertices. So, the number of internal vertices is $\( 3 + 3 = 6 \)$.

$\[ \text{Number of pendant vertices} = 22 - 6 = 16 \]$

Therefore, there are 16 pendant vertices in tree T.
