## Q-1) Define simple graph, degree of a vertex and complete graph.
**Answer:**
1. **Simple Graph:** 
   - A simple graph is an undirected graph where there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices and there are no self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
   - Mathematically, a simple graph $\( G \)$ can be defined as $\( G = (V, E) \)$, where $\( V \)$ is the set of vertices and $\( E \)$ is the set of edges, such that $\( E \)$ consists of unordered pairs of distinct vertices.

2. **Degree of a Vertex:**
   - The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges incident to that vertex.
   - In a simple graph, the degree of a vertex $\( v \)$, denoted by $\( \text{deg}(v) \)$, is the count of edges connected to vertex $\( v \)$.
   - Mathematically, for a vertex $\( v \)$, the degree $\( \text{deg}(v) \)$ can be calculated as the number of elements in the set of edges incident to $\( v \)$.

3. **Complete Graph:**
   - A complete graph is a simple graph where each pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.
   - In a complete graph with $\( n \)$ vertices, there are $\( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \)$ edges, as every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
   - Mathematically, a complete graph $\( K_n \)$ can be represented as a graph with $\( n \)$ vertices where each vertex is adjacent to every other vertex.

**Summary:**
A simple graph is one without self-loops or multiple edges, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, and a complete graph has every pair of distinct vertices connected by a unique edge.

**Points to Remember:**
- **Simple Graph:** No self-loops or multiple edges.
- **Degree of a Vertex:** Number of edges incident to the vertex.
- **Complete Graph:** Every pair of vertices connected by a unique edge.

### Q-2) A graph $\( G \)$ has 15 edges, 3 vertices of degree 4 and other vertices of degree 3. Find the number of vertices in $\( G \)$.

**Answer:**
Given:
- Total number of edges, $\( E = 15 \)$.
- Number of vertices with degree 4, $\( n_4 = 3 \)$.
- Number of vertices with degree 3, $\( n_3 \)$.

Let $\( n \)$ be the total number of vertices in $\( G \)$.

Using the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is twice the number of edges:

$$
2E = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{deg}(v_i)
$$

Given:
- $\( n_4 \)$ vertices with degree 4, each contributing 4 to the sum.
- $\( n_3 \)$ vertices with degree 3, each contributing 3 to the sum.

So, we have:

$$
2E = 3 \times 4 + n_3 \times 3
$$
$$
2 \times 15 = 12 + 3n_3
$$
$$
30 = 12 + 3n_3
$$
$$
3n_3 = 30 - 12
$$
$$
3n_3 = 18
$$
$$
n_3 = \frac{18}{3} = 6
$$

Now, the total number of vertices $\( n \)$ can be found by considering the vertices with degrees 4 and 3:

$$
n = n_4 + n_3 = 3 + 6 = 9
$$

So, the number of vertices in $\( G \)$ is $\( \boxed{9} \)$.

**Summary:**
The graph $\( G \)$ has 9 vertices.

**Points to Remember:**
- Use the Handshaking Lemma to relate the sum of vertex degrees to the number of edges.
- Subtract the degrees of known vertices from the total sum to find the degrees of other vertices.
- Use the relationship between edges and degrees to find the total number of vertices.


### Q-3) Define vertex disjoint and edge disjoint subgraphs by drawing the relevant graphs.

**Answer:**
Vertex disjoint subgraphs:
- Two or more subgraphs are considered vertex disjoint if they do not share any common vertices.
- Here's an illustration of two vertex disjoint subgraphs:

```
Subgraph 1:
      A
     / \
    B   C

Subgraph 2:
      D
     / \
    E   F
```

Edge disjoint subgraphs:
- Two or more subgraphs are considered edge disjoint if they do not share any common edges.
- Here's an illustration of two edge disjoint subgraphs:

```
Subgraph 1:         Subgraph 2:
   A---B              D---E
    \ /                \ /
     C                  F
```

**Summary:**
- Vertex disjoint subgraphs do not share any common vertices, while edge disjoint subgraphs do not share any common edges.

**Points to Remember:**
- Vertex disjoint subgraphs have no common vertices.
- Edge disjoint subgraphs have no common edges.

### Q-4) Define the following by drawing graphs:
(i) weak component 
(ii) unilateral component 
(iii) strong component.

**Answer:**
(i) Weak component:
- A weak component of a directed graph is a maximal subgraph in which every pair of vertices is reachable from each other by some path, ignoring the direction of edges. 
- Here's an illustration of a weak component:

```
   A -----> B
    \       |
     \      |
      \     v
       --> C
```

(ii) Unilateral component:
- A unilateral component of a directed graph is a maximal subgraph in which there are directed paths from every vertex to every other vertex.
- Here's an illustration of a unilateral component:

```
   A -----> B -----> C
   |        |        ^
   v        v        |
   D ------ E <------
```

(iii) Strong component:
- A strong component of a directed graph is a maximal subgraph in which every pair of vertices is reachable from each other by directed paths.
- Here's an illustration of a strong component:

```
   A <----> B       D -----> E
    \      |        |        ^
     \     |        v        |
      \    v        F <------
       --> C
```

**Summary:**
- Weak component: Maximal subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
- Unilateral component: Maximal subgraph with directed paths from every vertex to every other vertex.
- Strong component: Maximal subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex via directed paths.

**Points to Remember:**
- Weak component ignores edge directions.
- Unilateral component ensures directed paths from every vertex to every other vertex.
- Strong component considers directed paths between every pair of vertices.

## Q-5) Use Warshall's algorithm to obtain the path matrix from the adjacency matrix $\( A \)$:

Given adjacency matrix $\( A \)$:

$\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]$

**Solution:**

1. **Initialize the path matrix $\( P \)$ with the same dimensions as the adjacency matrix $\( A \)$:**

$$
\[
P = A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
$$

2. **Apply Warshall's Algorithm:**

For $\( k = 1 \)$:

$$
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
$$

For $\( k = 2 \)$:

$$
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
$$

For $\( k = 3 \)$:

$$
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
$$

3. **Path Matrix (Transitive Closure):**

$$
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
$$

The path matrix obtained represents the transitive closure of the given graph, indicating whether there exists a path between every pair of vertices.

**Summary:**

After applying Warshall's algorithm to the given adjacency matrix, we obtained the path matrix representing the transitive closure of the graph. The path matrix indicates the existence of paths between every pair of vertices in the graph.

**Points to Remember:**
- Warshall's algorithm is used to find the transitive closure of a directed graph.
- It iteratively updates the path matrix based on the existence of paths between vertices in the graph.
- The final path matrix indicates whether there exists a path between every pair of vertices in the graph.


## Q-6) Prove that there are always an even number of vertices of odd degree in a graph.

**Proof:**

Let's consider a graph $\( G \)$ with $\( V \)$ vertices and $\( E \)$ edges.

1. **Handshaking Lemma:**
   The Handshaking Lemma states that in any graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges. In mathematical terms:

$$
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \text{{degree}}(v) = 2|E|
\]
$$

3. **Counting Odd-Degree Vertices:**
   Let $\( O \)$ be the set of vertices with odd degrees. We want to prove that $\( |O| \)$ is always even.

4. **Sum of Degrees of Vertices:**
   From the Handshaking Lemma, we know that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is even (twice the number of edges). Since each edge contributes exactly two to the sum of degrees, the total sum must be even.

5. **Even Sum with Odd-Degree Vertices:**
   Suppose $\( |O| \)$ is odd. Each vertex in $\( O \)$ contributes an odd degree to the total sum of degrees. Therefore, the sum of degrees of vertices in $\( O \)$ is odd.

6. **Contradiction:**
   However, we have established that the total sum of degrees is even. If $\( |O| \)$ were odd, then the sum of degrees of vertices in $\( O \)$ would be odd, leading to a contradiction.

7. **Conclusion:**
   Since assuming $\( |O| \)$ as odd leads to a contradiction, $\( |O| \)$ must be even.

Hence, there are always an even number of vertices of odd degree in a graph.

**Summary:**

In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree is always even. This can be proved by considering the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of degrees of all vertices is even. By contradiction, assuming an odd number of vertices with odd degree leads to a contradiction with the Handshaking Lemma, thus proving that the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.

**Points to Remember:**
- The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is twice the number of edges.
- In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree is always even.
- This property holds true for both simple and multigraphs.


## Q-7) Find the number of edges in an $\( r \)$-regular graph with $\( n \)$ vertices.

**Solution:**

An $\( r \)$-regular graph is a graph in which each vertex has degree $\( r \)$, i.e., each vertex is incident to $\( r \)$ edges.

1. **Degree of Each Vertex:**
   In an $\( r \)$-regular graph, each vertex has degree $\( r \)$. Therefore, the total degree sum of all vertices is $\( n \times r \)$.

2. **Counting Edges:**
   Each edge in the graph contributes to the degree of two vertices. Since each vertex has degree $\( r \)$, it is incident to $\( r \)$ edges. Therefore, if we count each edge twice (once for each incident vertex), the total degree sum of all vertices will be equal to twice the number of edges.

3. **Equation:**
   We can express this relationship as an equation:

   $\[
   \text{{Total degree sum of all vertices}} = 2 \times \text{{Number of edges}}
   \]$

   $\[
   n \times r = 2 \times \text{{Number of edges}}
   \]$

4. **Finding Number of Edges:**
   Solving for the number of edges:

   $\[
   \text{{Number of edges}} = \frac{{n \times r}}{2}
   \]$

**Example:**
Let's consider an example where $\( r = 3 \)$ (each vertex has degree 3) and $\( n = 6 \)$ (6 vertices).

$\[ \text{{Number of edges}} = \frac{{6 \times 3}}{2} = 9 \]$

So, an $\( r \)$-regular graph with 6 vertices and each vertex having degree 3 will have 9 edges.

**Summary:**

In an $\( r \)$-regular graph with $\( n \)$ vertices, each vertex has degree $\( r \)$. The total number of edges in such a graph can be calculated using the formula:

$\[
\text{{Number of edges}} = \frac{{n \times r}}{2}
\]$

This formula represents the relationship between the total degree sum of all vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

**Points to Remember:**
- In an $\( r \)$-regular graph, each vertex has degree $\( r \)$.
- The total number of edges in an $\( r \)$-regular graph with $\( n \)$ vertices is given by $\( \frac{{n \times r}}{2} \)$.


## Q-8: Define self-loop, adjacent vertices, and a pendant vertex.

**Definitions:**

1. **Self-loop:**
   A self-loop is an edge in a graph that connects a vertex to itself. In other words, it is an edge where both endpoints are the same vertex. A graph can have zero or more self-loops.
   
   ```
   o ---o
   |     |
   |     |
   o ---o
   ```

2. **Adjacent Vertices:**
   Two vertices in a graph are said to be adjacent if there exists an edge that connects them. In other words, vertices \( u \) and \( v \) are adjacent if there is an edge between \( u \) and \( v \).
   
   ```
   o ---o
   |  /  |
   | /   |
   o ---o
   ```

3. **Pendant Vertex:**
   A pendant vertex is a vertex in a graph that has degree 1, meaning it is connected to only one other vertex in the graph. Essentially, it is a leaf vertex in a graph, connected to only one other vertex by an edge.
   
   ```
   o ---o     o
   |        / 
   |       /  
   o ---o
   ```

**Summary:**

- A **self-loop** is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
- Two vertices are **adjacent** if there exists an edge between them.
- A **pendant vertex** is a vertex with degree 1 and is connected to only one other vertex in the graph.

**Points to Remember:**
- A self-loop connects a vertex to itself.
- Adjacent vertices are connected by an edge.
- A pendant vertex has degree 1 and is connected to only one other vertex.


## Q-9: Find the number of edges in G if it has 5 vertices each of degree 2.

To find the number of edges in a graph $\( G \)$ with 5 vertices, each of degree 2, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.

Given that each vertex in $\( G \)$ has a degree of 2, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is $\( 5 \times 2 = 10 \)$.

According to the Handshaking Lemma, the number of edges in $\( G \)$ is half of the sum of the degrees of all vertices, which is $\( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)$.

So, the number of edges in $\( G \)$ is **5**.

**Summary:**
- Number of vertices $\( (n) \)$ = 5
- Degree of each vertex $\( (d) \)$ = 2
- Using Handshaking Lemma: $\( \text{Number of edges} = \frac{n \times d}{2} \)$
- $\( \text{Number of edges} = \frac{5 \times 2}{2} = 5 \)$

**Points to Remember:**
- The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.
- In a graph where each vertex has a degree of 2, the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees of all vertices.

## Q-10: Define complement of a subgraph by drawing the graphs.

The complement of a subgraph is formed by including all the edges that are not present in the original subgraph, while excluding the edges that are present in the original subgraph.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

Consider the following graph $\( G \)$ with vertices $\( V = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)$ and edges ( E = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)):

```
   1 ------- 2
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   4 ------- 3
```

Now, let's define a subgraph $\( H \)$ with vertices $\( V' = \{1, 2, 3\} \)$ and edges ( E' = (1, 2), (2, 3) )in the original graph $\( G \)$:

```
   1 ------- 2
             |
             |
             3
```

The complement of subgraph $\( H \)$, denoted as $\( \overline{H} \)$, will include all the edges that are not present in subgraph $\( H \)$, but are present in the original graph $\( G \)$. 

In this case, the complement of subgraph $\( H \)$ will include the edge $\( (3, 4) \)$ and $\( (4, 1) \)$, which are present in graph $\( G \)$ but not in subgraph $\( H \)$.

So, the complement of subgraph $\( H \)$ will look like this:

```
   1 ------- 2
   |         |
   |         |
   4 ------- 3
```

This illustration demonstrates how the complement of a subgraph is formed by including all the edges that are not present in the original subgraph, while excluding the edges that are present in the original subgraph.

**Summary:**
- The complement of a subgraph includes all the edges that are not present in the original subgraph.
- It is formed by excluding the edges that are present in the original subgraph.
  
**Points to Remember:**
- The complement of a subgraph includes all edges not present in the original subgraph.
- It is formed by excluding edges present in the original subgraph.


## Q-11: Define path and circuit of a graph by drawing the graphs.

A **path** in a graph is a sequence of vertices in which each vertex is connected to the next vertex by an edge. The path does not repeat any vertex, although it may repeat edges.

A **circuit** in a graph is a closed path where the starting and ending vertices are the same. Like a path, it also does not repeat any vertex (except for the starting and ending vertex), although it may repeat edges.

Let's illustrate these concepts with examples:

### Path:
Consider the following graph $\( G \)$:

```
   1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4
          |         |
          5 ------- 6
```

In this graph, a path from vertex $\( 1 \)$ to vertex $\( 4 \)$ can be represented as $\( 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 \)$. This is a sequence of vertices connected by edges.

### Circuit:
Consider the following graph $\( G \)$:

```
   1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4
    \             /
     \           /
       --- 5 ---
```

In this graph, a circuit that starts and ends at vertex $\( 1 \)$ can be represented as $\( 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 \)$. It forms a closed loop, visiting each vertex exactly once (except for the starting and ending vertex), and traversing each edge exactly once.

**Summary:**
- A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where no vertex is repeated (except for the starting and ending vertex).
- A circuit in a graph is a closed path where the starting and ending vertices are the same, traversing each vertex and edge exactly once.

**Points to Remember:**
- A path is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, with no vertex repeated.
- A circuit is a closed path where the starting and ending vertices are the same, traversing each vertex and edge exactly once.


## Q-12

## Q-13: Define indegree and outdegree of a graph with example.

The **indegree** and **outdegree** of a graph refer to the number of edges incident to each vertex in a directed graph.

- **Indegree**: For a vertex $\(v\)$ in a directed graph, the indegree is the number of edges entering $\(v\)$. It represents the number of edges directed towards the vertex.

- **Outdegree**: For a vertex $\(v\)$ in a directed graph, the outdegree is the number of edges leaving $\(v\)$. It represents the number of edges directed away from the vertex.

Let's consider an example to illustrate indegree and outdegree:

```
   1 --> 2 --> 3 <-- 4
    \         / \
     --> 5 --   -->
```

In this directed graph, we have five vertices labeled from $\(1\)$ to $\(5\)$. Now, let's calculate the indegree and outdegree for each vertex:

- **Vertex 1**: Indegree = $\(1\)$ (edge from $\(5\)$ to $\(1\)$), Outdegree = $\(2\)$ (edges from $\(1\)$ to $\(2\)$ and from $\(1\)$ to $\(5\)$).
- **Vertex 2**: Indegree = $\(2\)$ (edges from $\(1\)$ to $\(2\)$ and from $\(3\)$ to $\(2\)$), Outdegree = $\(2\)$ (edges from $\(2\)$ to $\(3\)$ and from $\(2\)$ to $\(5\)$).
- **Vertex 3**: Indegree = $\(3\)$ (edges from $\(2\)$ to $\(3\)$, from $\(4\)$ to $\(3\)$, and from $\(5\)$ to $\(3\)$), Outdegree = $\(1\)$ (edge from $\(3\)$ to $\(4\)$).
- **Vertex 4**: Indegree = $\(1\)$ (edge from $\(3\)$ to $\(4\)$), Outdegree = $\(2\)$ (edges from $\(4\)$ to $\(2\)$ and from $\(4\)$ to $\(3\)$).
- **Vertex 5**: Indegree = $\(1\)$ (edge from $\(2\)$ to $\(5\)$), Outdegree = $\(2\)$ (edges from $\(5\)$ to $\(1\)$ and from $\(5\)$ to $\(3\)$).

**Summary:**
- Indegree of a vertex in a directed graph is the number of edges entering the vertex.
- Outdegree of a vertex in a directed graph is the number of edges leaving the vertex.

**Example:**
In the directed graph above:
- Indegree and Outdegree of Vertex 1: $\(1\)$ and $\(2\)$ respectively.
- Indegree and Outdegree of Vertex 2: $\(2\)$ and $\(2\)$ respectively.
- Indegree and Outdegree of Vertex 3: $\(3\)$ and $\(1\)$ respectively.
- Indegree and Outdegree of Vertex 4: $\(1\)$ and $\(2\)$ respectively.
- Indegree and Outdegree of Vertex 5: $\(1\)$ and $\(2\)$ respectively.

**Points to Remember:**
- Indegree represents the number of edges entering a vertex in a directed graph.
- Outdegree represents the number of edges leaving a vertex in a directed graph.


## Q-14: Does a 3-regular graph with 5 vertices exist?

To determine whether a 3-regular graph with 5 vertices exists, let's first understand what a 3-regular graph is. 

- A **3-regular graph** is a graph in which each vertex has a degree of 3, meaning each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices.

Now, for a graph to be 3-regular with 5 vertices, it must satisfy the following conditions:
1. Each vertex must have a degree of 3.
2. The total sum of degrees in the graph must be even (by Handshaking Lemma).

Let's check if such a graph exists:

If all vertices have degree 3, then the total sum of degrees would be \(5 \times 3 = 15\). However, since each edge contributes 2 to the total sum of degrees (one to each of the vertices it's incident upon), the total sum of degrees must be even. But \(15\) is odd, which violates this condition.

Therefore, it's impossible for a 3-regular graph with 5 vertices to exist.

**Summary:**
- A 3-regular graph is a graph where each vertex has a degree of 3.
- For a 3-regular graph with 5 vertices to exist, the total sum of degrees must be even, which is not the case (it's odd). Therefore, such a graph does not exist.

**Points to Remember:**
- A 3-regular graph with \(n\) vertices must have a total sum of degrees equal to \(2 \times n\).
- If the total sum of degrees is odd, then a 3-regular graph cannot exist.

## Q-15: Define centre of a graph.

The **centre of a graph** refers to the set of vertices with minimum eccentricity. 

- **Eccentricity**: The eccentricity of a vertex in a graph is defined as the maximum distance between that vertex and any other vertex in the graph.

The centre of a graph is essentially the set of vertices that are closest to all other vertices in the graph, minimizing the maximum distance to any other vertex.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

Consider the following undirected graph:

```
          A
         / \
        B - C
       / \ / \
      D - E - F
```

In this graph, the eccentricity of each vertex is as follows:
- Eccentricity of A: 2 (maximum distance to any other vertex is 2)
- Eccentricity of B: 2
- Eccentricity of C: 2
- Eccentricity of D: 3
- Eccentricity of E: 2
- Eccentricity of F: 3

The vertices A, B, and C have an eccentricity of 2, which is the minimum eccentricity in this graph. Therefore, the centre of this graph consists of vertices {A, B, C}.

**Summary:**
- The centre of a graph is the set of vertices with minimum eccentricity.
- It consists of vertices that are closest to all other vertices in the graph, minimizing the maximum distance to any other vertex.

**Points to Remember:**
- Eccentricity measures the maximum distance between a vertex and any other vertex in the graph.
- The centre of a graph contains vertices with the minimum eccentricity.

## Q-16: Define Complete Graph

A **complete graph** is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. 

In other words, in a complete graph:
- Every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex.
- There are no isolated vertices or missing edges.

The number of edges in a complete graph with $\( n \)$ vertices can be determined using the following formula:

$\[ \text{Number of edges} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \]$

For example, a complete graph with 4 vertices would look like this:

```
   A -- B
   | \/ |

```

In this complete graph:
- Vertex A is connected to vertices B, C, and D.
- Vertex B is connected to vertices A, C, and D.
- Vertex C is connected to vertices A, B, and D.
- Vertex D is connected to vertices A, B, and C.

Thus, every pair of distinct vertices (A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D) is connected by a unique edge, making it a complete graph.

**Summary:**
- A complete graph is a simple undirected graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.
- There are no isolated vertices or missing edges in a complete graph.

**Points to Remember:**
- A complete graph with $\( n \)$ vertices has $\( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \)$ edges.
- Complete graphs are often denoted as $\( K_n \)$, where $\( n \)$ represents the number of vertices.


## Q-17: How many nodes are necessary to construct a graph with exactly 8 edges in which each node is of degree 2?

To construct a graph where each node has a degree of 2 and there are exactly 8 edges, we can start by analyzing the degree of each node.

Given that each node has a degree of 2, it means that each node is connected to exactly two other nodes. Therefore, for each edge added, we connect two nodes together. 

To calculate the total number of nodes required, we need to consider that each edge connects two nodes. So, for 8 edges, we need $\( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \)$ pairs of nodes.

Thus, we need a total of $\( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)$ nodes to construct a graph with exactly 8 edges, where each node has a degree of 2.

**Summary:**
- To construct a graph with exactly 8 edges, where each node has a degree of 2, we need 8 nodes.
  
**Points to Remember:**
- Each edge connects two nodes.
- To find the number of nodes required for a given number of edges, divide the number of edges by 2.

These diagrams visually represent the characteristics of each type of graph, aiding in understanding their definitions.


## Q-21: Draw a graph which is regular but not bipartite.

When we say a graph is "not bipartite," it means that the graph cannot be divided into two disjoint sets of vertices such that each edge of the graph connects vertices from different sets. In other words, it's impossible to color the vertices of the graph with two colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

In the context of graph theory, a bipartite graph is one where the vertices can be partitioned into two sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. 

So, in this case, a graph that is "not bipartite" cannot be divided into such sets of vertices. 

Let's incorporate this explanation into the answer:

When we say a graph is "not bipartite," it means that the graph cannot be divided into two disjoint sets of vertices such that each edge of the graph connects vertices from different sets. In other words, it's impossible to color the vertices of the graph with two colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

To draw a graph that is regular but not bipartite, let's consider a simple example of a regular graph that contains an odd cycle. Let's draw a regular graph with 6 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 2.

```
      A
     / \
    B - C
   / \ / \
  D - E - F
```

In this graph:
- Each vertex has a degree of 2, making it a regular graph.
- However, it contains an odd cycle (A-B-C-D-E-F-A), making it not bipartite.

**Summary:**
- The graph is regular because each vertex has a degree of 2.
- It is not bipartite because it contains an odd cycle.

## Q-22: Explain the following terms with proper illustrations.
a) Directed graphs
b) Simple and elementary path  
c) Reachability of a vertex
d) Connected graph.

### a) Directed Graphs:
A directed graph, also known as a digraph, is a graph in which edges have a direction associated with them. Each edge in a directed graph is represented by an arrow pointing from one vertex (called the source or tail) to another vertex (called the target or head). Directed graphs can represent relationships where direction matters, such as one-way streets, dependencies, or flow networks.

**Example:**

```
   A --> B
   |     |
   V     V
   D <-- C
```

### b) Simple and Elementary Path:
- **Simple Path:** A simple path in a graph is a path that does not contain repeated vertices. In other words, all vertices in the path are distinct. A simple path may pass through the same edge more than once, but it does not visit the same vertex more than once.
- **Elementary Path:** An elementary path is a simple path in which no edge is repeated. In an elementary path, both vertices and edges are distinct throughout the path.

**Example of a Simple Path (Not Elementary):**
```
   A -- B -- C
    \       /
     \     /
      D -- E
```

### c) Reachability of a Vertex:
The reachability of a vertex in a graph refers to the ability to reach that vertex from another vertex by following edges in the graph. In a directed graph, reachability determines whether there exists a directed path from one vertex to another. If there is a path from vertex A to vertex B, then vertex B is reachable from vertex A.

**Example:**
In the directed graph below, vertex C is reachable from vertex A because there is a directed path (A -> B -> C).

```
   A -> B -> C
```

### d) Connected Graph:
A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices. In other words, for every pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one path that connects them. If a graph is not connected, it may consist of multiple connected components, where each connected component is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected.

**Example:**
In the graph below, all vertices are connected, forming a single connected component.

```
   A -- B -- C
    \   |   /
      D -- E
```

**Summary:**
- **Directed Graphs:** Graphs with edges having a direction associated with them.
- **Simple and Elementary Path:** Paths in a graph with specific conditions on vertex and edge repetition.
- **Reachability of a Vertex:** Ability to reach a vertex from another vertex in a graph.
- **Connected Graph:** A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.



## Q-23: Show that the sum of in-degrees of all the nodes of a simple digraph is equal to the sum of out-degrees of all the nodes and this sum equal to the number of edges in it.

To prove this statement, let's consider a simple directed graph $\( G = (V, E) \)$, where:
- $\( V \)$ is the set of vertices.
- $\( E \)$ is the set of edges.

Let's denote:
- $\( \text{in-degree}(v) \)$ as the in-degree of vertex $\( v \)$, which is the number of edges entering vertex $\( v \)$.
- $\( \text{out-degree}(v) \)$ as the out-degree of vertex $\( v \)$, which is the number of edges leaving vertex $\( v \)$.

We want to prove that:

$$
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \text{in-degree}(v) = \sum_{v \in V} \text{out-degree}(v) = |E|
\]
$$

### Proof:
Let's consider each edge in the graph. Each edge contributes to the in-degree of one vertex and the out-degree of another vertex.

1. **Sum of In-degrees:**
   The in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges entering it. Therefore, summing the in-degrees over all vertices counts each edge exactly once, as each edge contributes to the in-degree of one vertex.

$$
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \text{in-degree}(v) = |E|
\]
$$

2. **Sum of Out-degrees:**
   Similarly, the out-degree of a vertex is the number of edges leaving it. Summing the out-degrees over all vertices also counts each edge exactly once, as each edge contributes to the out-degree of one vertex.

$$
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \text{out-degree}(v) = |E|
\]
$$

Hence, we have shown that the sum of in-degrees of all nodes in a simple digraph is equal to the sum of out-degrees of all nodes, and this sum is equal to the number of edges in the graph.

**Summary:**
- In a simple digraph, the sum of in-degrees of all nodes equals the sum of out-degrees of all nodes, which is equal to the number of edges in the graph.

This property holds true for any simple digraph, regardless of its specific structure.

## Q-25)

## Q-26: Use Warshall's algorithm to find the transitive closures of the relation $\( R = \{(1,4),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,4),(4,3)\} \)$ on $\( \{1,2,3,4\} \)$.

Warshall's algorithm is used to find the transitive closure of a relation in a directed graph. The transitive closure of a relation $\( R \)$ on a set $\( A \)$ is the smallest relation $\( R^+ \)$ such that $\( R \subseteq R^+ \)$ and $\( R^+ \)$ is transitive.

### Steps of Warshall's Algorithm:
1. **Initialize:** Create a matrix representation of the relation $\( R \)$ and set the entry $\( r_{ij} \)$ to 1 if $\( (i, j) \)$ is in $\( R \)$, otherwise set it to 0.
2. **Closure Calculation:** Use dynamic programming to calculate the transitive closure. For each pair of vertices $\( (i, j) \)$, if there exists a vertex $\( k \)$ such that both $\( r_{ik} \)$ and $\( r_{kj} \)$ are 1, then set $\( r_{ij} \)$ to 1.
3. **Result:** The resulting matrix represents the transitive closure of the relation.

### Warshall's Algorithm Implementation:

Given the relation $\( R = \{(1,4),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,4),(4,3)\} \)$, let's represent it as a matrix:

$$
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
$$

### Step 1: Initialize Matrix $\( A \)$
$$
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
$$

### Step 2: Closure Calculation
$\( r_{ij} = \max(r_{ij}, r_{ik} \land r_{kj}) \)$ for all $\( i, j, k \)$

![step2](https://i.imgur.com/rrXO1rX.png)!

### Resulting Matrix:
$$
\[
A' = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
$$

The resulting matrix $\( A' \)$ represents the transitive closure of the relation $\( R \)$ on the set $\( \{1,2,3,4\} \)$.

**Summary:**
- By applying Warshall's algorithm, we found the transitive closure of the given relation $\( R \)$ on the set $\( \{1,2,3,4\} \)$.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

## Q-27) Explanation of Path and Circuit in a Graph

In graph theory, both paths and circuits are fundamental concepts that describe sequences of vertices and edges within a graph.

**Path:**
- A path in a graph $\( G \)$ is a sequence of vertices $\( v_1, v_2, ..., v_n \)$ such that each adjacent pair of vertices in the sequence is connected by an edge in $\( G \)$. 
- Formally, a path $\( P \)$ in $\( G \)$ is defined as $\( P = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) \)$ where $\( (v_i, v_{i+1}) \)$ is an edge in $\( G \)$ for $\( 1 \leq i < n \)$.

**Circuit:**
- A circuit in a graph $\( G \)$ is a closed path where the start vertex is the same as the end vertex, except possibly for the last edge.
- Formally, a circuit $\( C \)$ in $\( G \)$ is defined as $\( C = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n, v_1) \)$ where $\( (v_i, v_{i+1}) \)$ is an edge in $\( G \)$ for $\( 1 \leq i < n \)$, and $\( v_1 = v_n \)$.

**Illustration:**
Consider the following graph:

```
A --- B --- C
|     |     |
D --- E --- F
```

- **Path:** $\( A \rightarrow B \rightarrow E \rightarrow F \)$ is a path in the graph.
- **Circuit:** $\( A \rightarrow B \rightarrow E \rightarrow D \rightarrow A \)$ is a circuit in the graph.

**Characteristics:**
- **Path:**
  - It may visit a vertex more than once but not repeat an edge.
  - A simple path is a path with no repeated vertices.
- **Circuit:**
  - It starts and ends at the same vertex.
  - A simple circuit is a circuit with no repeated vertices except for the start/end vertex.

**Summary:**
Paths and circuits are essential concepts in graph theory that describe sequences of vertices and edges. A path is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, while a circuit is a closed path that starts and ends at the same vertex. These concepts are fundamental for understanding connectivity and traversal within graphs.

(Answer is Half)

## Q-36: Prove that any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.

To prove that any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree, we can utilize the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$\[ 2|E| = \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) \]$

where:
- $\( |E| \)$ is the number of edges in the graph.
- $\( \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) \)$ is the sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph.

Now, let's consider the sum of the degrees of all vertices:

$\[ \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) \]$

Each edge contributes exactly 2 to the sum of the degrees because each edge is incident to 2 vertices. Therefore, if we sum up the degrees of all vertices, we count each edge twice, resulting in $\( 2|E| \)$. 

Hence, we have:

$\[ 2|E| = \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) \]$

Now, let's denote:
- $\( n \)$ as the number of vertices in the graph.
- $\( n_o \)$ as the number of vertices with odd degree.
- $\( n_e \)$ as the number of vertices with even degree.

From the Handshaking Lemma, we know that:

$\[ 2|E| = \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) \]$

$\[ 2|E| = \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2n_o + 2n_e \]$

Since $\( 2|E| = 2n_o + 2n_e \)$, we can simplify it to:

$\[ |E| = n_o + n_e \]$

This equation indicates that the number of edges is equal to the sum of the number of vertices with odd degree and the number of vertices with even degree. Since each edge contributes one to both the odd and even degrees, the sum of these degrees must be even.

Since the sum of the degrees of all vertices is even (as it is equal to $\( 2|E| \)$), the number of vertices of odd degree must be even to maintain the equation's balance. Therefore, any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.


## Q-37: Define Isolated vertex, Pendant vertex, and Size of a graph.

1. **Isolated Vertex**: An isolated vertex in a graph is a vertex that has no adjacent edges, meaning it is not connected to any other vertex in the graph. It is a vertex with degree zero.

2. **Pendant Vertex**: A pendant vertex in a graph is a vertex that is connected to exactly one other vertex by an edge. It is also referred to as a leaf vertex in a tree.

3. **Size of a Graph**: The size of a graph refers to the number of edges in the graph. It is denoted by $\(|E|\)$, where $\(E\)$ represents the set of edges in the graph.

## Q-38: Let $\( G \)$ be a graph with $\( n \)$ vertices and $\( m \)$ edges such that vertices have degree $\( k \)$ or $\( k + 1 \)$. Prove that if $\( G \)$ has $\( N(k) \)$ vertices of degree $\( k \)$ and $\( N(k+1) \)$ vertices of degree $\( k + 1 \)$, then $\( N(k) = (k + 1)n - 2m \)$.

Given:
- $\( n \)$ vertices with degrees $\( k \)$ or $\( k + 1 \)$.
- $\( N(k) \)$ vertices of degree $\( k \)$.
- $\( N(k + 1) \)$ vertices of degree $\( k + 1 \)$.

We know that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges in the graph, according to the Handshaking Lemma. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$\[ 2|E| = \sum_{v \in V} \text{deg}(v) \]$

Given that the graph has $\( N(k) \)$ vertices of degree $\( k \)$ and $\( N(k + 1) \)$ vertices of degree $\( k + 1 \)$, we can express the sum of the degrees of all vertices as:

$\[ \sum_{v \in V} \text{deg}(v) = N(k) \cdot k + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1) \]$

Since the graph has $\( n \)$ vertices, we can express the number of edges $\( |E| \)$ in terms of $\( n \)$, $\( N(k) \)$, and $\( N(k + 1) \)$:

$\[ |E| = \frac{1}{2} \left( N(k) \cdot k + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1) \right) \]$

Given that each edge is incident on two vertices, we have:

$\[ |E| = \frac{N(k) \cdot k + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \]$

Given $\( m \)$ edges in the graph, we can equate $\( |E| \)$ to $\( m \)$:

$\[ m = \frac{N(k) \cdot k + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \]$

Now, let's solve for $\( N(k) \)$:

$\[ 2m = N(k) \cdot k + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1) \]$

$\[ 2m = N(k) \cdot k + N(k) \cdot (k + 1) + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1) \]$

$\[ 2m = N(k) \cdot k + N(k) \cdot k + N(k) + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1) \]$

$\[ 2m = 2N(k) \cdot k + N(k) + N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1) \]$

$\[ 2m = 2N(k) \cdot k + N(k) + N(k + 1) \cdot k + N(k + 1) \]$

$\[ 2m = (2N(k) + N(k + 1)) \cdot k + N(k) + N(k + 1) \]$

$\[ 2m = (2N(k) + N(k + 1)) \cdot k + (N(k) + N(k + 1)) \]$

$\[ 2m = (2N(k) + N(k + 1)) \cdot k + n \]$

$\[ 2m = (2N(k) + N(k + 1)) \cdot k + n \]$

$\[ 2m - n = (2N(k) + N(k + 1)) \cdot k \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n - N(k + 1) \cdot k}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1) \cdot k}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1)}{2} \cdot k \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1)}{2} \cdot k \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1) - N(k + 1)}{2} \cdot k \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1) \cdot (k + 1 - k)}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1)}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1)}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n}{2} - \frac{N(k + 1)}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{2m - n - N(k + 1)}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{(2m - n - N(k + 1) \cdot k)}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = \frac{(2m - n - N(k + 1) \cdot k)}{2} \]$

$\[ N(k) = (k + 1)n - 2m \]$

Therefore, $\( N(k) = (k + 1)n - 2m \)$. 

This completes the proof.


## Q-39: Does there exist a 4-regular graph with 6 vertices? If so, construct the graph.

To determine if a 4-regular graph with 6 vertices exists, let's first check if it satisfies the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.

For a 4-regular graph with 6 vertices:
- Total degree sum = $\( 4 \times 6 = 24 \)$
- According to the Handshaking Lemma, this sum should be twice the number of edges, i.e., $\( 2 \times |E| \)$

So, $\( 24 = 2 \times |E| \)$, which implies that $\( |E| = 12 \)$.

Now, let's construct the graph:

We can represent a 4-regular graph with 6 vertices by arranging the vertices in a circle, with each vertex connected to the next 4 vertices in a clockwise direction. This configuration ensures that each vertex has a degree of 4.

```
    1 --- 2
   /|\    |\
  / | \   | \
 6  |  \  |  3
  \ |   \ | /
   \|    \|/
    5 --- 4
```

In this graph:
- Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 6, 5, and 4.
- Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, 6, and 4.
- Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2, 4, 5, and 1.
- Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 3, 2, 5, and 6.
- Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 4, 3, 1, and 6.
- Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 5, 1, 2, and 4.

Therefore, a 4-regular graph with 6 vertices exists, and the graph is constructed as shown above.

## Q-40: Define cycle, walk, and tree.

1. **Cycle**: In graph theory, a cycle is a closed path in a graph, where a path is a sequence of edges that connect a sequence of vertices. A cycle must have at least three vertices and three edges, and it forms a closed loop with no repeated vertices or edges, except for the starting and ending vertex which are the same.

2. **Walk**: A walk in a graph is a finite sequence of vertices and edges, starting from a vertex and ending at a vertex, where each vertex is adjacent to the next one in the sequence. The edges in a walk represent the connections between the vertices traversed. A walk may revisit vertices and edges multiple times.

3. **Tree**: In graph theory, a tree is a connected acyclic graph, meaning it is a graph in which there are no cycles, and every pair of vertices is connected by exactly one simple path. A tree with $\( n \)$ vertices has $\( n - 1 \)$ edges, and it is a fundamental data structure used in computer science for hierarchical data representation and searching algorithms.

These definitions are fundamental concepts in graph theory and are used to describe various properties and structures of graphs.


### Q-41: Find the transitive closure by Warshall's Algorithm if $\( A = \{1,2,3,4,5\} \)$ and $\( R = \{(1,4),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,4),(4,3)\} \)$

To find the transitive closure of the relation $\( R \)$ using Warshall's Algorithm, we first represent the relation $\( R \)$ as an adjacency matrix. Then, we apply the Warshall's Algorithm to compute the transitive closure.

Given relation $\( R = \{(1,4),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,4),(4,3)\} \)$, the adjacency matrix $\( A \)$ will be:

$$\[
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]$$

Now, we apply Warshall's Algorithm:

- Step 0 (Initial Matrix):

$$\[
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]$$

- Step 1:
$\[
A^{(1)} = A^{(0)} \cup (A^{(0)} \times A^{(0)})
\]$

- Step 2:
$\[
A^{(2)} = A^{(1)} \cup (A^{(1)} \times A^{(1)})
\]$

- Step 3:
$\[
A^{(3)} = A^{(2)} \cup (A^{(2)} \times A^{(2)})
\]$

- Step 4:
$\[
A^{(4)} = A^{(3)} \cup (A^{(3)} \times A^{(3)})
\]$

Now, we have the transitive closure matrix $\( A^{(4)} \)$. Let's compute it:

$$\[
A^{(4)} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]$$

This matrix represents the transitive closure of the relation $\( R \)$. Each entry $\( (i, j) \)$ with a value of 1 indicates that there exists a path from vertex $\( i \)$ to vertex $\( j \)$ in the original relation $\( R \)$. 

So, the transitive closure of $\( R \)$ is:
$\[ \{(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)\} \]$


### Q-44: Let $\( X = \{1,2,3,4\} \)$ and $\( R = \{(x,y) \mid x > y\} \)$. Draw the graph of $\( R \)$ and also provide its matrix representation.

Explanation:

The relation $\( R = \{(x,y) \mid x > y\} \)$ represents a relation where the first element of each ordered pair is greater than the second element. Let's draw the graph of this relation:

Graph of $\( R \)$:

```
      1
     / \
    /   \
   2     2
  / \   / \
 3   3 4   3
/     /     \
4     4       4
```

Matrix Representation:
The matrix representation of the relation $\( R \)$ can be obtained by assigning a 1 to positions where the relation holds true (i.e., $\( x > y \)$), and 0 otherwise.

$$\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]$$

This matrix represents the relation $\( R \)$, where $\( R[i][j] = 1 \)$ if $\( i > j \)$ and $\( R[i][j] = 0 \)$ otherwise.

### Q-48: Define null graph, center of a graph, and complete graph.

Explanation:

1. **Null Graph**:
   - A null graph, denoted by $\( N_n \)$, is a graph with $\( n \)$ vertices and no edges.
   - Characteristics:
     - Contains only isolated vertices.
     - No edges between any pair of vertices.
   - Example: $\( N_5 \)$ is a null graph with 5 vertices and no edges.

2. **Center of a Graph**:
   - The center of a graph is the set of vertices with minimum eccentricity.
   - Eccentricity of a vertex is the maximum distance from that vertex to any other vertex in the graph.
   - In a connected graph, the center is a single vertex or a pair of adjacent vertices.
   - In a disconnected graph, each connected component may have its own center.
   - Example: In a star graph, the center is the central vertex.

3. **Complete Graph**:
   - A complete graph, denoted by $\( K_n \)$, is a graph with $\( n \)$ vertices where each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a unique edge.
   - Characteristics:
     - Contains $\( \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2} \)$ edges.
     - Each vertex has degree $\( n-1 \)$.
   - Example: $\( K_4 \)$ is a complete graph with 4 vertices where each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge.

These definitions provide insights into different types of graphs based on their structures and connectivity.
