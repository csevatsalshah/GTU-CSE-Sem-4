## Let S = {a, b, c, d}. The following multiplication table, define operations ∙ on S. Is 〈S, ∙〉 semigroup? Justify
To determine if the algebraic structure 〈S, ∙〉, where S = {a, b, c, d} and the operation ∙ is defined by the given multiplication table, forms a semigroup, we need to check if the operation satisfies the closure property and the associative property.

Given multiplication table:

```
∙  a  b  c  d
--------------
a | a  b  c  d
b | b  a  a  b
c | c  b  a  a
d | d  a  a  a
```

1. **Closure Property**:
For a semigroup, the operation must be closed within the set S. This means that for any two elements x and y in S, the operation x ∙ y should also result in an element that belongs to S.

To check the closure property, we need to verify if the result of any two elements from S under the operation ∙ is also an element of S.

By examining the multiplication table, we can observe that for any combination of elements from S, the result is also an element from S. For example:

- a ∙ b = b (belongs to S)
- b ∙ c = a (belongs to S)
- c ∙ d = a (belongs to S)
- ... and so on.

Therefore, the closure property is satisfied for the given operation ∙ on the set S.

2. **Associative Property**:
For a semigroup, the operation must be associative. This means that for any three elements x, y, and z in S, the following equality must hold:

(x ∙ y) ∙ z = x ∙ (y ∙ z)

To check the associative property, we need to verify if the above equality holds for all possible combinations of elements from S.

Let's consider a few examples:

- For x = a, y = b, and z = c:
  (a ∙ b) ∙ c = b ∙ c = a
  a ∙ (b ∙ c) = a ∙ a = a
  Therefore, (a ∙ b) ∙ c ≠ a ∙ (b ∙ c)

- For x = b, y = c, and z = d:
  (b ∙ c) ∙ d = a ∙ d = a
  b ∙ (c ∙ d) = b ∙ a = a
  Therefore, (b ∙ c) ∙ d = b ∙ (c ∙ d)

By checking different combinations of elements, we can find that the associative property does not hold for all cases.

Since the associative property is not satisfied for the given operation ∙ on the set S, we can conclude that the algebraic structure 〈S, ∙〉 does not form a semigroup.
