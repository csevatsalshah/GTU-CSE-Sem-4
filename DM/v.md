## Q-5: Is the algebraic system (Q, *) a group? Where Q is the set of rational numbers and * is a binary operation defined by a*b = a + b - ab, ∀ a,b ∈ Q.

**Answer:**

To determine if the algebraic system (Q, *) is a group, we need to check if it satisfies the four properties of a group:

1. **Closure**: For all a, b in Q, a*b is also in Q.
2. **Associativity**: For all a, b, c in Q, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).
3. **Identity**: There exists an element e in Q such that for all a in Q, a*e = a.
4. **Inverse**: For each element a in Q, there exists an element b in Q such that a*b = e.

Let's check each property:

**Closure:**

Let a, b be any two rational numbers in Q. We need to show that a*b = a + b - ab is also a rational number in Q.

Since a and b are rational numbers, we can write them as a = p/q and b = r/s, where p, q, r, and s are integers.

Then, a*b = (p/q) + (r/s) - (p/q)*(r/s) = (ps + qr - pr)/qs.

Since ps + qr - pr and qs are integers, a*b is a rational number in Q. Therefore, the operation * is closed.

**Associativity:**

Let a, b, c be any three rational numbers in Q. We need to show that (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).

Using the definition of *, we have:

(a*b)*c = ((a + b - ab) + c - (a + b - ab)*c)
= (a + b - ab + c - ac - bc + abc)

a*(b*c) = (a + (b + c - bc) - a*(b + c - bc))
= (a + b + c - bc - ab - ac + abc)

After simplifying both expressions, we can see that they are equal:

(a*b)*c = a*(b*c)

Therefore, the operation * is associative.

**Identity:**

We need to find an element e in Q such that for all a in Q, a*e = a.

Let e = 1. Then, for any a in Q, we have:

a*e = a*1 = a + 1 - a*1 = a

So, e = 1 is the identity element.

**Inverse:**

For each element a in Q, we need to find an element b in Q such that a*b = e = 1.

Let b = 1/(2 - a). Then, we have:

a*b = a*(1/(2 - a)) = a + (1/(2 - a)) - a/(2 - a) = 1

So, b = 1/(2 - a) is the inverse of a.

**Conclusion:**

We have shown that the algebraic system (Q, *) satisfies all four properties of a group:

* Closure: a*b is a rational number in Q for all a, b in Q.
* Associativity: (a*b)*c = a*(b*c) for all a, b, c in Q.
* Identity: e = 1 is the identity element, such that a*e = a for all a in Q.
* Inverse: for each a in Q, there exists an element b in Q such that a*b = e = 1.

Therefore, the algebraic system (Q, *) is a group.

**Summary:**

* The algebraic system (Q, *) is a group, where Q is the set of rational numbers and * is a binary operation defined by a*b = a + b - ab.
* The operation * satisfies the four properties of a group: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.

**Points to Remember:**

* A group must satisfy the four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.
* The algebraic system (Q, *) is a group, where Q is the set of rational numbers and * is a binary operation defined by a*b = a + b - ab.
* The identity element is e = 1, and each element a has an inverse element b = 1/(2 - a).
  
**Q-6: Prove that the set {0,1,2,3,4} is a finite Abelian group under addition modulo 5 as a binary operation.**

**Answer:**

To prove that the set {0,1,2,3,4} is a finite Abelian group under addition modulo 5, we need to show that it satisfies the four properties of a group:

1. **Closure**: For all a, b in {0,1,2,3,4}, a + b (mod 5) is also in {0,1,2,3,4}.
2. **Associativity**: For all a, b, c in {0,1,2,3,4}, (a + b) + c (mod 5) = a + (b + c) (mod 5).
3. **Identity**: There exists an element e in {0,1,2,3,4} such that for all a in {0,1,2,3,4}, a + e (mod 5) = a.
4. **Inverse**: For each element a in {0,1,2,3,4}, there exists an element b in {0,1,2,3,4} such that a + b (mod 5) = e.

Additionally, we need to show that the group is Abelian, meaning that the operation is commutative: for all a, b in {0,1,2,3,4}, a + b (mod 5) = b + a (mod 5).

**Proof:**

**Closure:**

Let a, b be any two elements in {0,1,2,3,4}. We need to show that a + b (mod 5) is also in {0,1,2,3,4}.

Since a and b are in {0,1,2,3,4}, we know that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 4. Therefore, 0 ≤ a + b ≤ 8.

When we take the result modulo 5, we get:

a + b (mod 5) = (a + b) % 5

Since 0 ≤ a + b ≤ 8, we have:

0 ≤ (a + b) % 5 ≤ 4

This shows that a + b (mod 5) is always in {0,1,2,3,4}, satisfying the closure property.

**Associativity:**

Let a, b, c be any three elements in {0,1,2,3,4}. We need to show that (a + b) + c (mod 5) = a + (b + c) (mod 5).

Using the definition of modular addition, we have:

(a + b) + c (mod 5) = ((a + b) % 5) + c (mod 5)
= ((a + b) % 5 + c) % 5

Similarly,

a + (b + c) (mod 5) = (a + (b + c) % 5) % 5
= (a + ((b + c) % 5)) % 5

Since addition modulo 5 is associative, we have:

((a + b) % 5 + c) % 5 = (a + ((b + c) % 5)) % 5

Therefore, (a + b) + c (mod 5) = a + (b + c) (mod 5), satisfying the associativity property.

**Identity:**

The identity element e is 0, since for all a in {0,1,2,3,4}, a + 0 (mod 5) = a.

**Inverse:**

For each element a in {0,1,2,3,4}, the inverse element b is such that a + b (mod 5) = 0.

We can find the inverse of each element as follows:

* 0 has inverse 0, since 0 + 0 (mod 5) = 0.
* 1 has inverse 4, since 1 + 4 (mod 5) = 0.
* 2 has inverse 3, since 2 + 3 (mod 5) = 0.
* 3 has inverse 2, since 3 + 2 (mod 5) = 0.
* 4 has inverse 1, since 4 + 1 (mod 5) = 0.

**Commutativity (Abelian property):**

For all a, b in {0,1,2,3,4}, we need to show that a + b (mod 5) = b + a (mod 5).

Using the definition of modular addition, we have:

a + b (mod 5) = (a + b) % 5
= (b + a) % 5
= b + a (mod 5)

Therefore, the operation is commutative, and the group is Abelian.

**Conclusion:**

We have shown that the set {0,1,2,3,4} satisfies the four properties of a group under addition modulo 5, and that the operation is commutative. Therefore, {0,1,2,3,4} is a finite Abelian group under addition modulo 5.

**Summary:**

* The set {0,1,2,3,4} is a finite Abelian group under addition modulo 5.
* The operation is commutative, meaning that a + b (mod 5) = b + a (mod 5) for all a, b in {0,1,2,3,4}.
* The identity element is 0, and each element has an inverse element.

**Points to Remember:**

* A group must satisfy the four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.
* An Abelian group is a group where the operation is commutative.
* Modular addition is a binary operation that satisfies the properties of a group.
* The set {0,1,2,3,4} is a finite Abelian group under addition modulo 5.

  
## Let S = {a, b, c, d}. The following multiplication table, define operations ∙ on S. Is 〈S, ∙〉 semigroup? Justify
To determine if the algebraic structure 〈S, ∙〉, where S = {a, b, c, d} and the operation ∙ is defined by the given multiplication table, forms a semigroup, we need to check if the operation satisfies the closure property and the associative property.

Given multiplication table:

```
∙  a  b  c  d
--------------
a | a  b  c  d
b | b  a  a  b
c | c  b  a  a
d | d  a  a  a
```

1. **Closure Property**:
For a semigroup, the operation must be closed within the set S. This means that for any two elements x and y in S, the operation x ∙ y should also result in an element that belongs to S.

To check the closure property, we need to verify if the result of any two elements from S under the operation ∙ is also an element of S.

By examining the multiplication table, we can observe that for any combination of elements from S, the result is also an element from S. For example:

- a ∙ b = b (belongs to S)
- b ∙ c = a (belongs to S)
- c ∙ d = a (belongs to S)
- ... and so on.

Therefore, the closure property is satisfied for the given operation ∙ on the set S.

2. **Associative Property**:
For a semigroup, the operation must be associative. This means that for any three elements x, y, and z in S, the following equality must hold:

(x ∙ y) ∙ z = x ∙ (y ∙ z)

To check the associative property, we need to verify if the above equality holds for all possible combinations of elements from S.

Let's consider a few examples:

- For x = a, y = b, and z = c:
  (a ∙ b) ∙ c = b ∙ c = a
  a ∙ (b ∙ c) = a ∙ a = a
  Therefore, (a ∙ b) ∙ c ≠ a ∙ (b ∙ c)

- For x = b, y = c, and z = d:
  (b ∙ c) ∙ d = a ∙ d = a
  b ∙ (c ∙ d) = b ∙ a = a
  Therefore, (b ∙ c) ∙ d = b ∙ (c ∙ d)

By checking different combinations of elements, we can find that the associative property does not hold for all cases.

Since the associative property is not satisfied for the given operation ∙ on the set S, we can conclude that the algebraic structure 〈S, ∙〉 does not form a semigroup.
